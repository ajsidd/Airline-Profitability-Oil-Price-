# Project 1 - Group 8: Analyzing the Relationship Between Crude Oil Prices and Airline Profitability

## Objective

The main objective of our project is to examine the correlation between crude oil prices and airline profitability. We aim to uncover insights into how fluctuations in crude oil prices historically correlate with changes in airline profitability metrics and to understand the operational responses of airlines to significant changes in crude oil prices.

## Approach

We will employ data analysis techniques to explore the relationship between crude oil prices and key financial metrics of airlines. Our approach involves:

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**: Gathering historical data on crude oil prices and airline profitability metrics and ensuring data integrity through cleaning and preprocessing.
   
2. **Data Analysis**: Conducting statistical analysis to determine the strength and direction of the relationship between crude oil prices and airline profitability.
   
3. **Visualization**: Creating visual representations, such as graphs, scattered plots, and charts, to illustrate the correlation between oil prices and airline financial performance.

## Methodology

### Data Collection and Cleaning

We will collect historical data on crude oil prices from reliable sources and obtain financial metrics of airlines. Data will be cleaned and preprocessed to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### Data Analysis

Statistical techniques will be applied to analyze the relationship between crude oil prices and airline profitability metrics. We will determine correlation coefficients and conduct regression analysis to identify patterns and trends.

### Visualization

We will visualize our findings using graphs, scatter plots, and charts to effectively communicate the correlation between crude oil prices and airline financial performance.

## Deliverable

Our project will culminate in a comprehensive analysis report presenting:

- The relationship between crude oil prices and airline profitability through data visualization and statistical findings.
- Insights into the strength and direction of the relationship between crude oil prices and airline financial performance.
- Patterns or trends in the impact of crude oil trade price fluctuations on airline profitability.
- Operational responses of airlines to significant changes in crude oil prices and their effects on profitability.
- Identification of other factors affecting the profitability of airlines.

## Questions

Our analysis will address the following questions:

1. How do fluctuations in crude oil prices historically correlate with changes in airline profitability metrics?
2. Can statistical analysis provide insights into the strength and direction of the relationship between crude oil prices and airline financial performance?
3. Are there identifiable patterns or trends in the impact of crude oil trade price fluctuations and airline price fluctuation?
4. How did the individual airlines performed as compared to average profitability of worldwide airlines?
5. What other factors affect the profitability of airlines?

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!). Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Choose a self-explaining name for your project.

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Badges
On some READMEs, you may see small images that convey metadata, such as whether or not all the tests are passing for the project. You can use Shields to add some to your README. Many services also have instructions for adding a badge.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.

## Installation
Within a particular ecosystem, there may be a common way of installing things, such as using Yarn, NuGet, or Homebrew. However, consider the possibility that whoever is reading your README is a novice and would like more guidance. Listing specific steps helps remove ambiguity and gets people to using your project as quickly as possible. If it only runs in a specific context like a particular programming language version or operating system or has dependencies that have to be installed manually, also add a Requirements subsection.

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.

## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License
For open source projects, say how it is licensed.

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
