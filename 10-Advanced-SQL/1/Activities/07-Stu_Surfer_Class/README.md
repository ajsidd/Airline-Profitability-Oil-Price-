# Surfer Class

In this activity, you will create your own classes in Python.

## Instructions

* Create a class, `Surfer`, and initialize it with name, hometown, and rank-instance variables.

* Create an _instance_ of a surfer.

* Then, print the name, hometown, and rank of your surfer object.

## Bonus

* Create a `while` loop that will allow you to continuously create new instances of surfers using `input()`.

* Keep the loop going until otherwise specified by user input.
