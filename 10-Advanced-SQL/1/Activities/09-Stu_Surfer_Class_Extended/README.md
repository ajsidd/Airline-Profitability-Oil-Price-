# Surfer Class Extended

In this activity, you will rework your `Surfer` script as you add in methods to perform specific tasks.

## Instructions

* Create a `Surfer` class that has `name`, `hometown`, `rank`, and `wipeouts` instance variables.

* Create a method called `speak` that prints "Hang loose, bruh!"

* Create a method called `biography` that prints the surfer's name and hometown.

* Create a method called `cheer` that will print "I totally rock man, no wipeouts!" if the surfer has no wipeouts. Otherwise, it prints “Bummer, bruh, keep on keeping on!”

* Create two surfer instances of the Surfer class, and run all the methods.

## Bonus

Add a method to your class that prints out how many surfers are currently “shredding.”

## Hint

* Create a class variable shared by all instances of `Surfer`, and create an instance variable to increment it each time a new surfer is created.

* For more on class syntax and examples, refer to the [Python documentation on classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html).
