# Hide and Seek

In this activity, you will create a new table and import data from a CSV file. To learn more about this dataset, you may review the reference at the end of this document.

## Instructions

1. Open the `soft-attributes.csv` CSV file from the Resources folder to analyze the data.

2. Using the column headers and data types from the CSV file, write the table schema to create a new table in the `Miscellaneous_DB` database called `movie_words_comparison`.

3. Import the data from the `soft-attributes.csv` file in the Resources folder.

4. Create a query that collects all rows where `Home Alone (1990)` is in the `reference_title` column.

5. Create a query that collects all rows where the rater is within the 10-15 range.

6. Create a query that searches for the words `artsy` and `heartfelt` in the `soft_attribute` column.

## Bonus

* Create a query that will collect all rows with a reference title of `Batman (1989)` and a soft attribute of `scary`.

* Create a query that will collect all rows with a rater within the 30-40 range and has a reference title of `Home Alone (1990)` and a soft attribute of `artsy`.
