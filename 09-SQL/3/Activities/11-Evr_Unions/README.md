# Unions

In this activity, you will practice unions by combining data from tables without the use of joins.

## Instructions

* Using `UNION`, write a PostgreSQL statement to query the number of rows in tables `city` and `country`.

* Use `UNION` to display from the tables `customer` and `customer_list` the ID of all customers who live in the city of London. Determine whether both tables contain the same customers by using `UNION ALL`.

## Hint

For the second task, consider using subqueries.
