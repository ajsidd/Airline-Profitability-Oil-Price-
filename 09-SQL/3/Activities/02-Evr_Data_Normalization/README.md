# Pet Normalizer

In this activity, you will use data normalization practices.

## Instructions

1. In pgAdmin, create a new database called `pets_db`.

2. Use Excel to get the data into first normal form (1NF).

3. Using the normalized CSV, create the following tables with continued normalized practices:

 	A table for owners that takes an ID and the owner's name.

  	A table for pet names that takes two IDs, the pet's name, and the pet's type.

4. Using the CSV file as a guide, insert the data into their respective tables.

## Bonus

* Create a `service` table that displays the different types of services that are offered.

* Create a `pet_names_updated` table that takes an ID that will connect to the `services` table.

* Join all three tables.

## Hint

Be sure that each table has a unique primary key.
