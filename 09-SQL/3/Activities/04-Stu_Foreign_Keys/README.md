# Foreign Keys

In this activity, you will create and populate three new tables with foreign keys that reference existing data.

## Instructions

* Create a new database named `business_DB` to use with this activity.

* Make sure all tables have primary keys that increment with each new row of data.

1. Create a `customer` table with a customer first name and customer last name.

2. Populate the `customer` table with customer names.

3. Create a `customer_email` table with a foreign key that references a field in the original `customer` table.

4. Populate the `customer_email` table with emails.

5. Create a `customer_phone` table with a foreign key that references a field in the original `customer` table.

6. Populate the `customer_phone` table with phone numbers.

7. To test your understanding of foreign keys, write a query to insert data in the `customer_phone` table by using a reference ID that does not exist in the `customer` table.

8. Join all three tables.

## Hint

Think about how you can select certain columns in a table. Use those columns as a reference to insert data into a table.
