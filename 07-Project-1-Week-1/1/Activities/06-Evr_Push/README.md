# Pushing to GitHub

In this activity, the students will gain experience adding remotes and using `git push`.

## Instructions

* Create a new GitHub repo to associate with the local Git repo that you've been working on so far. Add it as the `origin` remote.

* Next, check out your `main` branch, and push it to GitHub.

* Create a new branch, and change something in your project (edit one of your existing files, add a new one, etc). Add and commit this change, and push your new branch to GitHub.

* Checkout `main`, and merge it with the branch that you just created.

* Push the updated `main` branch to GitHub.

## Bonus

* Use the `-u` flag the first time you use `git push` to set default upstream branches for `main` and the branch you create.
