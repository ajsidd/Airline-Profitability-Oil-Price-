# Merging Into main

In this activity, you will practice merging local changes into `main`. This activity must be completed **after** the `pull` activity; it cannot stand alone.

## Instructions

* After pulling changes from GitHub, each team member should checkout `main`.

* Next, each team member should merge the branch that they’ve created and named into `main`.

  * After merging, each team member should push their changes to GitHub.

* You may have difficulty at this point. As a team, try to figure out why.

* If Git refuses to `push`, run `git pull`, and try again.

  * Take a moment to discuss why this is necessary.

* Once everyone has pushed their changes to GitHub, each team member should pull the repository.

* After pulling, discuss newly added files with your teammates.

## Hint

* A common, extra-safe workflow is to _always_ `git pull` before you `git push` even if you expect that nothing has changed.
