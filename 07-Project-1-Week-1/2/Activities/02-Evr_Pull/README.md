# Git Pull

In this activity, you will practice pushing to and pulling from branches on GitHub.

## Instructions

* Elect a team leader for this activity. This leader will **create** and **push** changes to a repository that other members will **pull** from.

* **First, make sure to complete the following steps:**

  * The team leader should create a new GitHub repo.

  * Each member of the team should `clone` this repo to their computer..

* Next, on the `main` branch of the project, the team leader should add and commit a file called `data_exploration.py` and then push their changes to GitHub.

  * Team members should then pull these changes to their local machines.

* After pulling, each team member should **create a new branch** whose name follows the `<name>/branching_exercise` formula, where `<name>` is a placeholder for your name.

  * Next, each team member should add and commit a file named `<name>.txt`. Add a message to the file so that it can be committed.

  * After saving the file, each team member should push their respective branches to GitHub.

* Next, each team member should checkout the `main` branch.

* While on `main`, everyone should pull changes from GitHub.

* After pulling from GitHub, explore what's new (what teammates have added, etc.).

* Try checking out a team member's branch: `git checkout <team_member_name>/branching_exercise`.
