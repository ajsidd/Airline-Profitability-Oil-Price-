# Chi Square

In this activity, you will play the role of a café entrepreneur who owns four cafés in a town full of avid coffee drinkers.

## Instructions

| Cafe | Daily Visits |
| ---- | ------------ |
| #1   | 1500         |
| #2   | 1350         |
| #3   | 1600         |
| #4   | 1550         |


* Using a chi-square goodness-of-fit test, determine whether the results suggest if customers are more likely to frequent one cafe over another.

* Perform the necessary calculations by using Python.

* Then, perform the calculations by hand to verify your findings.

* Use a p-value of 0.05.

* Consult a chi-square table to find your critical value: <https://www.medcalc.org/manual/chi-square-table.php>
