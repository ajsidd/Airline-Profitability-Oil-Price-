# Number Facts API

In this activity, you’ll use Python to create a user-friendly way to get data from an API.

## Instructions

Using the [Numbers API](http://numbersapi.com), create an application that takes in a user's inputs and returns a number fact based upon it.

## Hints

* The URL to make your request must have `?json` at its end so that the data format returned is JSON. The default response is pure text.

* Make sure to read through the documentation when creating your application. Some types require more or less data than others.
