# Australian Airports Map

In this activity, you will create a map based on Australian airports information that you generated before using the Geoapify API.

## Instructions

1. Load airports' data into a Pandas DataFrame.

2. Create a simple map using GeoViews by adding a point per airport and setting a fixed size at your convenience.

3. Use GeoViews to create a custom map by setting values for color, size, and a title different than OSM.

  > **Hint:** From the column values, you should decide what columns can be used to set a different color and size for each city.
